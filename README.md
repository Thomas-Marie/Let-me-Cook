# Let me Cook üë®‚Äçüç≥ W.I.P ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Introduction

This project marks my first significant experience, driven by a concrete need and, above all, to enhance my skills. <br>

As it is in progress, the readme will be updated progressively. ‚è≥

the "feature" branch is the only one that is updated regularly.

## Steps

I followed the methods I learned, beginning with the conception phase, where I initiated the process by outlining **user stories.**

<br>
Then **wireframes** (of which I'm quite proud).
